# RunTASCIIc

This screensaver was constructed by me not only just for fun, but also as an excercise for
 GUI programming on Python.

 The screensaver opens a full-screen GUI window (black), randomly chooses a colour for text,
 randomly chooses version and shows you some random characters printed. It can be closed with any key pressed.

It also shows you a file from special folder line by line.

To use the screensaver:

1. Create a folder with a bunch of .py, .pl, .sh., .h and .c files, which contain code;
2. Set the folder to the screensaver code;
3. Run the screensaver;
4. PROFIT!!!
