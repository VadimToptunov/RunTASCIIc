# RunTASCIIc

This screensaver was constructed by me not only just for fun, but also as an excercise for
 GUI programming on Python.

 The screensaver opens a full-screen GUI window (black), randomly chooses a colour for text,
 randomly chooses version and shows you some random characters printed. It can be closed with any key pressed.

 The project will be improved in such ways:

 1. It will lock the screen for Linux if you do nothing;
 2. It will get the 3rd version, where random Python or file with some other extension
   will be shown as a text in the GUI window.
